        "Welcome to the fourth part of the Flower federated learning tutorial. In the previous parts of this tutorial, we introduced federated learning with PyTorch and Flower ([part 1](https://flower.dev/docs/tutorial/Flower-1-Intro-to-FL-PyTorch.html)), we learned how strategies can be used to customize the execution on both the server and the clients ([part 2](https://flower.dev/docs/tutorial/Flower-2-Strategies-in-FL-PyTorch.html)), and we built our own custom strategy from scratch ([part 3 - WIP](https://flower.dev/docs/tutorial/Flower-3-Building-a-Strategy-PyTorch.html)).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we revisit `NumPyClient` and introduce a new baseclass for building clients, simply named `Client`. In previous parts of this tutorial, we've based our client on `NumPyClient`, a convenience class which makes it easy to work with machine learning libraries that have good NumPy interoperability. With `Client`, we gain a lot of flexibility that we didn't have before, but we'll also have to do a few things the we didn't have to do before.\n",

        "\n",
        "First of all, it's more code. But why? The difference comes from the fact that `Client` expects us to take care of parameter serialization and deserialization. For Flower to be able to send parameters over the network, it eventually needs to turn these parameters into `bytes`. Turning parameters (e.g., NumPy `ndarray`'s) into raw bytes is called serialization. Turning raw bytes into something more useful (like NumPy `ndarray`'s) is called deserialization. Flower needs to do both: it needs to serialize parameters on the server-side and send them to the client, the client needs to deserialize them to use them for local training, and then serialize the updated parameters again to send them back to the server, which (finally!) deserializes them again in order to aggregate them with the updates received from other clients.\n",
        "\n",
        "The only *real* difference between Client and NumPyClient is that NumPyClient takes care of serialization and deserialization for you. It can do so because it expects you to return parameters as NumPy ndarray's, and it knows how to handle these. This makes working with machine learning libraries that have good NumPy support (most of them) a breeze.\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of API, there's one major difference: all methods in Client take exectly one argument (e.g., `FitIns` in `Client.fit`) and return exactly one value (e.g., `FitRes` in `Client.fit`). The methods in `NumPyClient` on the other hand have multiple arguments (e.g., `parameters` and `config` in `NumPyClient.fit`) and multiple return values (e.g., `parameters`, `num_example`, and `metrics` in `NumPyClient.fit`) if there are multiple things to handle. These `*Ins` and `*Res` objects in `Client` wrap all the individual values you're used to from `NumPyClient`."

In order to do so, it requires us to handle parameter serialization and deserialization ourselves."
